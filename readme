Program uses SQLite to store Sensor readings the given SensorDB.db includes some sensors and a few weeks of readings


json data sent by Raspberry pi Sensors.

{
    "sensor_id": "sensor_001",
    "temperature": 23.5,
    "error_state": false
}

My Opinion why "Measurement Delete" endpoint should not exist.
- median of lets say an hour of measurements would ignore any extreme readings
- error readings could be used to analyze when and where errors happen
- it is important not to bog down the backend with unnecessary operations
